<p class="p">
    The ACREX platform provides you with the world's leading one-stop quantitative trading. Through the ACREX artificial intelligence trading robot, it is based on scientific data and uses information and computing advantages such as big data and artificial intelligence to apply in the field of financial investment. to help investors maintain asset value, invest and provide value-added services.



【1】Mission first
We designed ACREX to put our overall mission of ensuring the creation and adoption of safe and beneficial AGI ahead of generating returns for investors.

Even in terms of the structure of ACREX, mission comes first. While we hope that what we describe below will work until our mission is complete, we may update our implementation as the world changes. No matter what happens in the world, we remain committed to our mission, both legally and personally.

ACREX's primary fiduciary duty is to advance the goals of the ACREX Charter, and the company is controlled by the ACREX for-profit organization's Board of Directors. All investors and employees sign an agreement stating that ACREX's obligations to the Charter will always come first, even at the expense of some or all financial shares.

Important This partnership exists to advance ACREX’s mission to ensure that safe general artificial intelligence is developed and benefits all humanity. The general partners' responsibility for this mission and the principles set forth in ACREX's Articles of Association take precedence over any obligation to generate profits. The partnership may never become profitable, and the general partners are under no obligation to do so. The general partners are free to reinvest any or all cash flows from the operating entity (or partnership) in research and development activities and/or related expenses without any obligation to the limited partners. Please see Section 6.4 of the Operating Entity Limited Partnership Agreement for further details.
(The paperwork for our employees and investors all starts in a big purple box like this. General partners refer to the ACREX for-profit organization (its legal name is “ACREX Inc”); limited partners refer to investors and employee.)

Only a few board members are allowed to hold a financial stake in the partnership at one time. Additionally, only board members who do not hold such shares may vote on decisions where the interests of limited partners may conflict with the mission of the ACREX for-profit organization, including any decisions regarding payments to investors and employees.

(Company structure)
ACREX will be a for-profit Delaware limited partnership managed by its general partner, a Delaware limited liability company controlled by the board of directors of ACREX Inc., a for-profit organization. At any time, no more than a handful of nonprofit board members hold any financial interest in ACREX or an employee-owned entity (as described below). (Another provision in our filings states that ACREX for-profit organization retains control.)
As noted above, financial returns to investors and employees are capped (the cap is determined in advance by each limited partner). Any excess proceeds will be donated to the ACREX for-profit organization. Our goal is to ensure that if successful, the majority of the value we create (monetary or otherwise) benefits everyone, so we feel this is an important first step. Investors in our first round were capped at 100x returns on their investments (commensurate with the risk we faced), and we expect higher multiples in future rounds as we make further progress.
